# LiveTwitterSentimentAnalysis

Live tweets from Twitter are streamed continuously using Kafka. After preprocessing and extracting text from the tweets, sentiment analysis is performed using TextBlob as well as Vader sentient analysis. The results are then stored in elasticsearch. Different visualizations are also created using Kibana.
